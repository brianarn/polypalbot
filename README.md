[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianarn/polypalbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianarn/polypalbot)

A Node.js-based Twitch chat bot to provide interesting data about some fun Polygon streams

## Plans

Early plans are to monitor some Polygon channels to determine the frequency of
times people say Boys, or Boys Per Minute (BPM).

Additionally, I'd like to get this thing wrapped in Docker at some point, but
for now this is fine for local playing around.

Also, eventually a happy client end to be handed out by the server.

## Setup

Currently, the main application lives in the [`server`](./server) directory. It
has its own setup instructions there.
